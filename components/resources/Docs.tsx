          Amorphix is an AI architect. You talk to it about who you are and what you love; it reads your taste with its own taste model and designs your space from it: a floor plan, a 3D walkthrough by day and night, a budget in your currency, a shopping list and a timeline. Then it stays with the project through review, approval and building.
